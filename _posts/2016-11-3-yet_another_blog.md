After delaying this for a few ~~weeks~~ ~~months~~ years. I'm finally
getting my hands out of my a** and starting to build myself a small
cozy place to post about the things I do. I'm sure this will be nice.

This blog is powered by the simple but fancy Jekyll static website
generator. An awesome thing is that you can find pretty nice themes
around, which is especially useful for people like me, with no CSS
skills whatsoever and no real plans to get any. Another cool feature
is that I can publish things without leaving my editor and
terminal. Thanks Jekyll.

I'd also like to thank [HTML5Up](https://html5up.net/) for their nice
theme and [andrew banchich](https://github.com/andrewbanchich/) for
the Jekyll adaptation.

See you soon with nice posts about my work on Chef and Scaleway
<i>cloud</i> platform.
